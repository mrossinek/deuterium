Given python (original code):
  import datetime

  now = datetime.datetime.now()
  print(a)

  def say_hi(name):
      print('Hi, ' + name)
  def say_bye(name):
      print('Bye, ' + name)

  def prompt_name(name):
      print(name + ', how old are you?')
      age = input('>>> ')
      print(age)


  class Foo:
      def __init__(self, name):
          self.name = name


  class Bar(Foo):
      def __init__(self, name):
          super.__init__(name)

      def __repr__(self):
          return name

Execute (replace with auto selections):
  let selections = []
  for line in range(1, line('$'))
    call cursor(line, 1)
    try
      let selections += [deuterium#auto_select()]
    catch /EmptyCode/
      let selections += [0]
    endtry
  endfor
  AssertEqual line('$'), len(selections)
  for line in range(1, line('$'))
    call setline(line, string(selections[line-1]))
  endfor

Expect (expected selections):
  [1, 1]
  0
  [3, 3]
  [4, 4]
